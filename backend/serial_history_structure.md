# Analysis of serial_number_history.json Structure

Based on a snippet from lines 100-150 of `Programs/serial_number_history.json`, here's an analysis of its structure and data elements:

**Overall Structure:**

The file appears to be a single JSON object. The keys of this main object are individual serial numbers (e.g., `"390.1094"`, `"390.1089"`, `"390.1090"`). The value associated with each serial number key is an array. This array contains one or more "event objects," each detailing a specific event in the history of that particular serial number.

**Event Object Structure:**

Each event object within the array consistently contains the following top-level data elements:

1.  `"event_type"`: A string that categorizes the event.
    *   Examples: `"InStock"`, `"Sale"`, `"Return"`.
2.  `"event_date"`: A string representing the date of the event, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".
    *   Example: `"2025-05-09"`.
3.  `"serial_number"`: A string that repeats the serial number to which this event pertains (matching the main key).
    *   Example: `"390.1094"`.
4.  `"details"`: A nested JSON object. The structure and data elements within this `"details"` object vary depending on the `"event_type"`.

**Structure of the `"details"` Object (based on `event_type`):**

*   **If `event_type` is `"InStock"`:**
    The `details` object contains information about the item when it was stocked.
    *   `"item_id"`: String (e.g., `"3565249000005880674"`) - Likely a unique identifier for the item.
    *   `"item_sku"`: String (e.g., `"P312R70"`) - Stock Keeping Unit.
    *   `"item_name"`: String (e.g., `"HiFi Rigid Endoscope - 3mm x 120mm 70 deg Reverse Post"`) - Descriptive name of the item.
    *   `"status"`: String (e.g., `"active"`) - Current status of the item.
    *   `"warehouse_name"`: String or `null` (e.g., `null`) - Name of the warehouse where it's stocked.

*   **If `event_type` is `"Sale"`:**
    The `details` object contains information related to a sales transaction.
    *   `"sales_order_id"`: String (e.g., `"3565249000008713019"`) - Unique ID for the sales order.
    *   `"sales_order_number"`: String (e.g., `"SO-00358"`) - Human-readable sales order number.
    *   `"sales_order_date"`: String (e.g., `"2024-11-05"`) - Date of the sales order.
    *   `"customer_id"`: String (e.g., `"3565249000003554329"`) - Unique ID for the customer.
    *   `"customer_name"`: String (e.g., `"Arizona Breathe Free Sinus Allergy Centers"`) - Name of the customer.
    *   `"item_sku"`: String (e.g., `"P312R45"`) - SKU of the item sold.
    *   `"item_name"`: String (e.g., `"HiFi Rigid Endoscope - 3mm x 120mm, 45 deg reverse post"`) - Name of the item sold.
    *   `"package_id"`: String (e.g., `"3565249000008724001"`) - Unique ID for the package.
    *   `"package_number"`: String (e.g., `"PKG-00509"`) - Human-readable package number.
    *   `"shipment_date"`: String or `null` (e.g., `null`) - Date the item was shipped.
    *   `"delivery_date"`: String or `null` (e.g., `null`) - Date the item was delivered.

*   **If `event_type` is `"Return"`:**
    The snippet for the "Return" event (starting at line 147 for serial number `"390.1090"`) is incomplete for its `details` object. However, it follows the same pattern of having `event_type`, `event_date`, and `serial_number` at the top level, and would presumably have its own specific set of data elements within its `details` object related to the return.

**How Data is "Loading":**

From the static JSON snippet, we can infer the data *structure* and how elements are *organized*. The term "how are they loading" could refer to how this JSON file is generated or consumed by a program. This JSON structure suggests it's designed to be easily parsed by software:
*   The top-level keys (serial numbers) allow for direct lookup of a specific serial's history.
*   The array of events for each serial is ordered, likely chronologically by `event_date`, though this would need confirmation by looking at more data or the generating script (`Programs/generate_serial_history.py`).
*   The conditional structure of the `details` object based on `event_type` means a program consuming this data would need to check the `event_type` before trying to access specific fields within `details`.
