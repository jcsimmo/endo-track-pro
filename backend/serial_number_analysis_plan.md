# Serial Number Analysis Plan - Oasis Clinic

## Objective
Determine if the "duplicate" serial numbers (390.2565, 380.0592, 380.0600, 380.0596) in the Oasis clinic data represent unique sales orders or actual duplicates.

## Current Findings

### Serial Number: 390.2565
- **Sales Order SO-00445** (shipped 2025-04-10) - Lines 1111-1114

### Serial Number: 380.0592  
- **Sales Order SO-00062** (shipped 2023-05-17) - Lines 15039-15048

### Serial Number: 380.0596
- **Sales Order SO-00062** (shipped 2023-05-17) - Lines 15039-15048 (same shipment as 380.0592)

### Serial Number: 380.0600
- **Sales Order SO-00383** (shipped 2024-12-30) - Lines 3289-3293
- **Sales Order SO-00075** (shipped 2023-06-19) - Lines 12694-12698
- **Sales Return RMA-00011** from SO-00075 - Lines 21706-21710

## Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Data Collection
For each serial number, systematically check ALL instances found in search results:

#### 390.2565 - Additional instances to check:
- Line 15123-15126 (score 0.76)
- Line 20652-20657 (score 0.76) 
- Line 15768-15772 (score 0.75)
- And all other results with score > 0.6

#### 380.0592 - Additional instances to check:  
- Line 3289-3293 (score 0.73)
- Line 21588-21592 (score 0.73)
- Line 18488-18491 (score 0.72)
- And continue through all results

#### 380.0600 - Additional instances to check:
- All remaining high-score results not yet examined

#### 380.0596 - Need complete search:
- Run codebase_search for "380.0596"
- Check all instances systematically

### Phase 2: Context Analysis
For each instance found:
1. Determine if it's within a sales order shipment
2. Extract salesorder_number and shipment_date
3. Check if it's within a sales return and link to original sales order
4. Note any other context (inventory, etc.)

### Phase 3: Timeline Construction
Build complete timeline showing:
- When each serial number was first shipped
- All subsequent shipments/returns/movements
- Whether reuse represents legitimate business flow or data error

### Phase 4: Final Assessment
Determine:
- Are these legitimate serial number reuses after returns?
- Are there actual duplicate/conflicting shipments?
- Do the "duplicate" alerts represent real data issues?

## Expected Outcome
A definitive answer on whether each "duplicate" serial number represents:
- **Legitimate reuse**: Serial numbers legitimately reused after returns/refurbishment
- **Data inconsistency**: Same serial number incorrectly appearing in multiple active shipments
- **Mixed pattern**: Some legitimate, some problematic

## Implementation Approach
1. Systematic file reading of all search result contexts
2. Data extraction and timeline building
3. Pattern analysis and business logic validation
4. Report generation with findings and recommendations
